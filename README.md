# CoordCalib
Select the four points of the working area in the image starting from the top left and moving clock-wise. 

Once the area has been defined, the world axis will be displayed in the center and any further click will transform the clicked pixel position into world coordinates on the defined working area.

TODO: Detect the four aruco markers and uses those to define the plane.
